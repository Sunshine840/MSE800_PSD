About this program
Middlemore Clinic required a software that should be able to do the following tasks

1.  Register and store all patients with information including Name, last name, age, gender, email, phone number.
2.  Program should be able to give us total count of doctors who are specialised in ophthalmology.
3.  Admins should be able list, view, search, patients and doctors by any attribute, modify this data when/if needed.(Current version only have minium functionality)
    To achieve those requirements we have used SQLite3 to store and retrive the data about the patients and doctors, as backend we have used python 3, we will be using 3 entities, patients, doctors and admins.

    Note: We assume that each doctor at Middlemore clinic has 1 specialization (Client needs to notify Project manager otherwise)
