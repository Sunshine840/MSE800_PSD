#About this program
In this program, Python 3 is used along with the SQLite3 database to store and retrieve data.
The system is designed using three entities: Student, Teacher, and Course.
Each entity is modeled as an independent class following Object Oriented Programming principles.
To maintain naming consistency, the database is named Yoobee, and it contains three tables—Student, Teacher, and Course—to store the corresponding data.
